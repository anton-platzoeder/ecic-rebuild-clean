Let me check the current workflow state.

**Current State:**
- **Epic:** 1 - Authentication, Authorization & User Management
- **Story:** 8 (last story of Epic 1)
- **Phase:** IMPLEMENT

Stories 1-7 are complete. This is the final story in Epic 1. Let me get more context on Story 8 and check for failing tests.

Good - the tests are failing as expected in TDD. The test file exists but the implementation page doesn't yet. Let me read the test file to understand what needs to be implemented.

Here's the current state summary:

**Current State:**
- **Epic:** 1 - Authentication, Authorization & User Management
- **Story:** 8 - Login Activity Monitoring (final story in Epic 1)
- **Phase:** IMPLEMENT
- **Route:** `/admin/users/login-activity`

**What's ready:**
- Test file exists at [page.test.tsx](web/src/app/admin/users/login-activity/__tests__/page.test.tsx) with 24 tests
- All API types and functions already defined in [audit.ts](web/src/lib/api/audit.ts) (`LoginAttempt`, `LoginActivityList`, `SecurityAlert`, `getLoginActivity`, `getLoginAlerts`, `exportLoginActivity`)
- The `unlockUserAccount` function exists in [users.ts](web/src/lib/api/users.ts)

**What's failing:**
- 1 test suite fails because `web/src/app/admin/users/login-activity/page.tsx` doesn't exist yet
- All 282 existing tests pass

**Is this correct? Should I proceed with the IMPLEMENT phase for Story 8?**

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

Handing off to the developer agent to implement Story 8.

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_



Task: Implement Story 8 Login Activity

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

The developer agent has completed its work. Let me check the test results.

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_



Bash: Run Story 8 tests to verify implementation

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

The implementation has a hoisting bug. Let me read the file and fix it.

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_



_Tools used: Read_

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

The issue is clear - `useCallback` declarations are used before initialization. I need to move `loadData` and `loadUsers` before the `useEffect` that references them.

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_



_Tools used: Edit_

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

Now let me run the tests again.

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_



Task: Review Story 8 implementation

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

The code review passed with **2 high-priority fixes needed**:

1. **Dynamic Tailwind classes** (lines 269-271) - template literals won't work in production
2. **Unused `err` variable** - lint warning

Let me fix both issues.

The next step is **STORIES phase for Epic 2**. Before proceeding, I'd recommend clearing context to free up the conversation window since Epic 1 was extensive.

**Would you like to:**
1. Run `/clear` then `/continue` to start Epic 2 with a fresh context (recommended)
2. Continue directly to Epic 2's STORIES phase now
