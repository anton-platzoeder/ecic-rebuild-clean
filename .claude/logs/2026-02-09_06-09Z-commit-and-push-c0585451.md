Let me check the current workflow state.

Bash: Detect detailed workflow state from artifacts

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

Here's the current workflow state:

**Current State:**
- **Epic:** 1 - Authentication, Authorization & User Management
- **Story:** 3 - User Lifecycle Management
- **Phase:** REALIGN
- **Progress:** Stories 1 and 2 are COMPLETE, stories 3-8 are PENDING

Stories 1 (User Authentication) and 2 (Role-Based Dashboard) have been fully implemented, reviewed, verified, and committed. We're now at the REALIGN phase for Story 3.

Does this look correct? Should I proceed with REALIGN for Story 3?
