I see there's an `api/node_modules` directory that shouldn't be committed. Let me check if there's a `.gitignore` for it.

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_



Bash: Check for .gitignore in api directory

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_



Bash: Check root .gitignore

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

The root `.gitignore` only has `/node_modules` (root-level only), so `api/node_modules` would be committed accidentally. Let me check the full `.gitignore` and fix this before committing.

I need to add `node_modules` (without leading slash) to the `.gitignore` so it covers all directories, including `api/node_modules`.

Now let me verify `api/node_modules` is properly ignored and list the api source files.

Good, `api/node_modules` is properly ignored. Now let me stage all the files and create the commit.

Everything looks correct. Now let me commit and push.

Bash: Push to remote

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

Done. Committed and pushed `e8b637a` to `main`:

**Replace NextAuth with custom JWT auth backed by Fastify API**
- Added Fastify API server (`api/`) with auth routes, JWT, RBAC middleware, and mock data
- Removed NextAuth.js and all related config/pages/session provider
- Simplified auth layer for JWT cookie flow
- Updated all integration tests, middleware, RoleGate, and protected layout
- Added dashboard API client and auth types
- Fixed `.gitignore` to exclude `node_modules` in all directories

Note: The remote suggests the repo has moved to `https://github.com/shamima-g/05-02-2026.git` â€” you may want to update your remote URL.
