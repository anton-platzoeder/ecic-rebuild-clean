Here's the current workflow state:

**Current State:**
- **Epic:** 1 - Authentication, Authorization & User Management
- **Story:** 4 - Role Assignment & Permission Management
- **Phase:** REALIGN
- **Progress:** Stories 1-3 COMPLETE, Stories 4-8 PENDING
- **Total Epics:** 6

Stories 1, 2, and 3 have been completed and committed. The workflow is now at the REALIGN phase for Story 4.

Does this look correct? Should I proceed with the REALIGN phase for Story 4?
