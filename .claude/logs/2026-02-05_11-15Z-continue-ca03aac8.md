**Current Workflow State:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Epic** | 1 - Authentication, Authorization & User Management |
| **Story** | 1 - User Authentication with AD/LDAP Integration |
| **Phase** | REALIGN |
| **Total Stories** | 8 stories in Epic 1 |
| **Total Epics** | 6 epics total |

**Story 1 Summary:** Implements login with AD/LDAP integration, session management (30-min timeout), login/logout functionality, account lockout after 3 failed attempts, and activity logging.

This is the **first story of the first epic** - it's foundational with no dependencies on other stories.

---

**Is this correct?** If yes, I'll proceed with the REALIGN phase using the feature-planner agent to check for any cross-story impacts before we move to SPECIFY (test generation).

Since this is the first story being implemented, REALIGN should be straightforward - there are no prior implementations to check for impacts against.

## REALIGN Complete for Epic 1, Story 1

I've completed the REALIGN phase for the first authentication story. This is the **first story in the first epic**, so there are no prior implementations to conflict with.

### Key Findings

## REALIGN Complete - Decision Required

The REALIGN phase found a discrepancy between the story and the OpenAPI spec:

### Issue: Missing API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Story Expects | OpenAPI Has |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Session retrieval | `GET /v1/auth/session` | âŒ Missing (but `/v1/auth/me` exists) |
| Logout | `POST /v1/auth/logout` | âŒ Missing |

### Existing Infrastructure Ready to Use
- âœ… API client (`lib/api/client.ts`)
- âœ… NextAuth scaffolding (needs AD/LDAP adaptation)
- âœ… Database schema complete
- âœ… `POST /v1/auth/login` and `GET /v1/auth/me` exist

### Resolution Options

| Option | Description | Trade-off |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **A** | Use `/auth/me` for session, client-side logout | Fastest, no backend changes |
| **B** | Add both missing endpoints to OpenAPI spec | More complete API, requires backend work |
| **C** | Use `/auth/me`, add only `/auth/logout` | Balanced - proper logout, minimal changes |

A discovered-impacts.md file has been created documenting this finding.

**Which option would you like?** (A, B, or C)
