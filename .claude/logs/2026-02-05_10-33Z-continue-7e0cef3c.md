**Current Workflow State:**
- **Feature:** brd_v2
- **Phase:** SCOPE
- **Epic:** 1 (not yet defined)

**Completed Artifacts:**
- âœ“ OpenAPI spec: [openapi.yaml](documentation/openapi.yaml)
- âœ“ Database schema: [user-management-schema.sql](documentation/user-management-schema.sql)
- âœ“ 18 wireframes + overview in [generated-docs/wireframes/](generated-docs/wireframes/)

**History:** DESIGN â†’ SCOPE (transitioned 2026-02-05)

---

**Is this correct?** The next step is to run the `feature-planner` agent to define all epics for this feature based on the BRD and wireframes.

If this looks right, I'll proceed with the SCOPE phase. If something seems off, please let me know what needs to be corrected.

**Result:**
Perfect. Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the InvestInsight platform. Let me analyze the BRD, wireframes, and existing architecture to define the epics. This is a complex enterprise platform with:

1. **Multi-level approval workflow** (3 levels with rejection capabilities)
2. **State-base...

Task: Define epics for brd_v2 feature

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

## Epic Plan for InvestInsight Platform

The feature-planner has analyzed the BRD and wireframes and proposes **6 epics** in dependency order:

| Epic | Name | Screens | Dependencies |
|------|------|---------|--------------|
| **1** | Authentication, Authorization & User Management | Dashboard, User Admin (14), Role Management (15) | None - foundational |
| **2** | Batch Management & Workflow State Control | Batch Mgmt (2), Workflow Viewer (6) | Epic 1 |
| **3** | Master Data Management & Reference Data | Instrument Master (7), Reference Data (13), Audit Trail (16) | Epic 2 |
| **4** | File Processing & Data Acquisition | File Status (3), File Processing Monitor (17) | Epic 3 |
| **5** | Portfolio Analytics & Risk Metrics | Index Prices (8), Risk (9), Volatility (10), Credit Ratings (11), Custom Holdings (12), Validation (4), Calc Monitor (18) | Epic 4 |
| **6** | Multi-Level Approval Workflow & Publication | Approval Review (5) | Epic 5 |

**Rationale:** Builds incrementally from auth foundation â†’ workflow container â†’ master data â†’ file intake â†’ analytics â†’ governance controls.

---

**Do you approve this epic structure?** 

Once approved, I'll:
1. Save the epics to `generated-docs/epics.md`
2. Transition to STORIES phase for Epic 1
3. Define the user stories for Authentication & User Management

## Epic 1 Stories - Authentication, Authorization & User Management

The feature-planner proposes **8 stories** for Epic 1:

### Foundation Stories
| # | Story | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | User Authentication with AD/LDAP Integration | External auth flow, session management, login logging |
| 2 | Role-Based Dashboard Landing | Role-specific dashboard after login |
| 3 | User Lifecycle Management | Admin CRUD for users with audit trails |
| 4 | Role Assignment & Permission Management | Assign roles, enforce segregation of duties |

### Advanced Stories
| # | Story | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 5 | Approval Authority Configuration | Configure approvers per level with backups |
| 6 | User Activity Logging & Audit Trail | Track actions, searchable audit viewer |
| 7 | Session Management & Authorization Checks | Secure sessions, timeout, permission checks |
| 8 | Login Activity Monitoring | Login attempts, failed logins, security alerts |

---

**Do you approve these stories?**

Once approved, the agent will create `generated-docs/epic-1-stories.md` with full details including:
- User story format (As a... I want... So that...)
- Acceptance criteria
- Referenced wireframes
- Story point estimates
