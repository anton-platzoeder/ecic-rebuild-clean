Now I have a clear picture. Here's the current state:

**Current Workflow State:**
- **Epic 1:** Authentication, Authorization & User Management - **COMPLETE** (8/8 stories done)
- **Epic 2:** Batch Management & Workflow State Control - **STORIES** phase (stories need to be defined)
- **Total Epics:** 6
- **Phase:** STORIES (defining stories for Epic 2)

Epic 1 is fully complete with all 8 stories implemented, reviewed, and verified. The workflow now needs to define the stories for **Epic 2: Batch Management & Workflow State Control**, which covers batch creation, workflow state machine (Data Preparation â†’ L1/L2/L3 Approval â†’ Published), state-based access control, and workflow audit trails.

Is this correct? Should I proceed with the STORIES phase for Epic 2?
