I'll help you resume the TDD workflow. Let me first check the current workflow state.

Let me check what documentation exists for this feature.

**Current Workflow State:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Feature | brd_v2 |
| Epic | 1 |
| Phase | SCOPE |
| Spec | [documentation/brd_v2.md](documentation/brd_v2.md) |

**Progress:**
- âœ… DESIGN phase complete - 18 wireframes created in [generated-docs/wireframes/](generated-docs/wireframes/)
- â³ SCOPE phase in progress - need to define all epics

No epics or stories have been defined yet. The workflow is ready to scope the feature into epics based on the BRD and wireframes.

**Is this correct?** Please confirm, and I'll invoke the `feature-planner` agent to define all epics for this feature.

Will you generate the API?


_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Good question - let me clarify what this project generates.

**This is a frontend-only template.** It generates:
- âœ… React components and pages
- âœ… API client code (calls to endpoints)
- âœ… TypeScript types from OpenAPI specs
- âŒ Backend API implementation

**No OpenAPI spec found** in `documentation/` - so currently there's no defined API contract.

You have a few options:

1. **Frontend with mocks** - Build the UI with mock data/MSW, connect to a real backend later
2. **Provide an OpenAPI spec** - If you have (or create) an API spec, I'll generate typed client code that matches it
3. **Generate an OpenAPI spec** - I can analyze the BRD and wireframes to draft an OpenAPI spec that defines the endpoints this frontend would need

Which approach would you like to take?

Why did you not ask me about the OpenAPI spec?


_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

You're right - that's an oversight.

According to the project's own rules (CLAUDE.md Layer 1 - Early Detection), the workflow should have checked for an OpenAPI spec **at the start** and asked you about it before proceeding through DESIGN and into SCOPE.

Instead, the workflow proceeded to create 18 wireframes without establishing how the frontend would communicate with a backend. That's backwards - the API contract often influences the UI design.

**I should have asked at the start:**
- Do you have an existing OpenAPI spec?
- Is there a backend already built?
- Should we draft an API spec based on the BRD before designing screens?

Would you like to:
1. **Pause and create an OpenAPI spec now** - before scoping epics
2. **Continue frontend-first** - scope epics, build UI with mocks, define API later
3. **Go back** - revisit wireframes after establishing the API contract

What's your preference?

Did the BRD not mention about database?


_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Let me check the BRD for database and backend requirements.

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_



_Tools used: Read_

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

You're absolutely right. The BRD explicitly mentions database requirements:

**Section 7.1 Assumptions:**
> "Infrastructure: Adequate server infrastructure and **database capacity** will be provisioned"

**Section 7.3 Dependencies:**
> "**Database Provisioning**: Requires database infrastructure provisioned by IT"

And the entire BRD describes a data-intensive system requiring:
- Master data management (instruments, prices, ratings, risk metrics)
- Audit trails with 7+ year retention
- Workflow state management
- Multi-source file integration
- User management and RBAC
- Historical comparison and reporting

This is clearly an enterprise application that needs a **database** and **backend API** - not just a frontend.

**I should have:**
1. Read the BRD at workflow start (DESIGN phase)
2. Identified the database/backend requirements
3. Asked you about the backend strategy before creating wireframes

Instead, the workflow proceeded to create 18 UI wireframes without establishing:
- Database schema
- API endpoints
- Backend architecture

**What would you like to do?**
1. **Define the backend now** - Create OpenAPI spec and database schema before scoping epics
2. **Start over** - Reset the workflow and address backend requirements first
3. **Something else** - Let me know your preference
