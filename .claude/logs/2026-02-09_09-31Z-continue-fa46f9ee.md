_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

Here's the current workflow state:

**Current State:**
- **Epic:** 1 - Authentication, Authorization & User Management
- **Story:** 3 - User Lifecycle Management
- **Phase:** VERIFY

Stories 1 and 2 are complete, and Story 3 is at the VERIFY stage (quality gate validation). Does this look correct? Should I proceed with running the quality gates for Story 3?

Running quality gates for Epic 1, Story 3 (User Lifecycle Management).

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_



Task: VERIFY Story 3 quality gates

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

All 5 quality gates passed for **Epic 1, Story 3 (User Lifecycle Management)**:

| 2. Build | PASS |
| 3. Tests | PASS (165 tests, 13 files) |

| 5. Security | PASS (0 vulnerabilities) |

Story 3 has been marked **COMPLETE** and committed to main.

**Progress: Epic 1** - Stories 1, 2, 3 complete. Stories 4-8 remaining.

**Next up:** Story 4 - Role Assignment & Permission Management

Before proceeding, I recommend clearing context to keep things fresh for the next story cycle.

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

Please run `/clear` to reset the context, then `/continue` to resume. The workflow will pick up at Story 4 (REALIGN phase).
