Here's the current workflow state:

**Current State:**
- **Feature:** brd_v2
- **Epic:** 1 - Authentication, Authorization & User Management
- **Story:** 1 - User Authentication with AD/LDAP Integration
- **Phase:** REALIGN
- **Progress:** Epic 1 of 6, Story 1 of 8

The REALIGN phase has been completed and a report was generated at [realign-report-epic1-story1.md](generated-docs/realign-report-epic1-story1.md). However, there is an **unresolved blocker** that requires your decision before proceeding to SPECIFY.

**Issue: Missing API Endpoints**

The story references two endpoints that are **not defined** in the OpenAPI spec:
- `POST /v1/auth/logout`
- `GET /v1/auth/session`

The spec currently provides `GET /v1/auth/me` (which can serve a similar role to `/auth/session`).

AskUserQuestion
Out: User has answered your questions: "How should we handle the missing /auth/logout and /auth/session endpoints?"="Option A: Use existing endpoints (Recommended)". You can now continue with the user's answers in mind.

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

Option A it is. Let me find the story file and update it, then transition to SPECIFY.

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

Good. Now let me also update the discovered-impacts file to record this decision, then transition.

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_



Bash: Transition Epic 1 Story 1 from REALIGN to SPECIFY

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

Transition successful. Now let me launch the test-generator agent to create the failing tests for Story 1.

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_



Task: Generate tests for Epic 1 Story 1

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

The SPECIFY phase is complete. Here's the summary:

## SPECIFY Phase Complete - Epic 1, Story 1

**45 test cases** created across 4 test files (all failing as expected â€” TDD red phase):

| Test File | Tests | Coverage |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| [page.test.tsx](web/src/app/login/__tests__/page.test.tsx) | 14 | Login form UI, validation, auth flow |
| [auth.test.ts](web/src/lib/api/__tests__/auth.test.ts) | 11 | API wrapper functions (login, getCurrentUser, refreshToken) |
| [session.test.ts](web/src/lib/auth/__tests__/session.test.ts) | 14 | Session timeout, activity tracking, logout |
| [auth-middleware.test.ts](web/src/__tests__/integration/epic-1-story-1-auth-middleware.test.ts) | 10 | Route protection, redirects |

**All acceptance criteria covered** (Happy Path, Session Management, Failed Auth, Inactive User, Activity Logging) plus accessibility tests.

**Phase transitioned** to IMPLEMENT.

---

**Ready for IMPLEMENT phase.** It's recommended to clear context first since the test generation was a large operation.

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_



AskUserQuestion
Out: User has answered your questions: "Would you like to clear context before starting the IMPLEMENT phase?"="Yes, clear first (Recommended)". You can now continue with the user's answers in mind.

---

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

Please run `/clear` and then `/continue` to resume the workflow with fresh context. The state is saved â€” you'll pick up at **IMPLEMENT** phase for Epic 1, Story 1.
