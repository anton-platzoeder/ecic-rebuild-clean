What still needs to be done for Epic 2 - Story 5?


_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-6)**_

Story 5 is nearly done. Here's where things stand:

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| REALIGN | Done |
| WRITE-TESTS | Done (86 tests, all passing) |
| IMPLEMENT | Done (utility, hook, UI icons) |
| QA - Code Review | Done - PASSED |
| **QA - Quality Gates + Commit** | **Remaining** |

**What's left:**
1. Run the 5 quality gates (tests, build, lint, test:quality, lint:fix)
2. Commit all changes
3. Transition state to COMPLETE

All code is implemented and tests pass. Want me to run the quality gates and commit?
